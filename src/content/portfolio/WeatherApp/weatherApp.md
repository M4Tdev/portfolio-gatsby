This web app gets your current location, communicates with weather API and displays weather for that location, also if you want to know weather in any other city/country you can add it to your saved locations and get weather for them. When you click on current or saved location you will get forecast for 5 days and than you can get even more precise weather info by clicking on specific time of the day.
