I'm Mateusz Lesiuk, a 21 years old Front End Developer from Poland.

I have always been interested in creating websites and web applications.
Finally, in November 2018 I have decided that I want to put in the work, and take it seriously.
I have started to wake up early and learn how to code. I have began by doing courses, and with gathered knowledge, I was practicing by making projects.
I am very curious, and I constantly want to improve the skills I already have, and I am willing to learn new ones.

Courses I took and mentioned above: [Front End Development on TeamTreeHouse](https://teamtreehouse.com/tracks/front-end-web-development), [JavaScript30 by WesBos](https://javascript30.com/), [ES6 by WesBos](https://es6.io/), [The Complete JavaScript Course](https://www.udemy.com/the-complete-javascript-course/), [React For Beginner by WesBos](https://reactforbeginners.com/), [Learn Redux by WesBos](https://learnredux.com/), [Modern React with Redux](https://www.udemy.com/react-redux/), [React - The Complete Guide (incl Hooks, React Router, Redux)](https://www.udemy.com/react-the-complete-guide-incl-redux/), [Gatsby Bootcamp](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8t0vNu2fCCM), also in the beginning I have read *"JavaScript & jQuery by Jon Duckett"* book.

If you are interested in projects I made with knowledge gathered from these courses you can check them out on the <scroll-link to="portfolio">portfolio</scroll-link> section.

I am passionate, committed, hard-working and also a fast learner.
