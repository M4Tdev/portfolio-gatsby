I'm Mateusz Lesiuk a Front End Developer from Poland.

I have always been interested in creating websites and web applications but I have not done anything serious about it.
Finally in November 2018 I have decided that I want to be a Web Developer and I took it seriously.
So I did, I have started to wake up early and learn how to code,
I started doing courses and over time I was using more and more documentation to learn from.

Courses I took and mentioned above: [Front End Development on TeamTreeHouse](https://teamtreehouse.com/tracks/front-end-web-development), [JavaScript30 by WesBos](https://javascript30.com/), [ES6 by WesBos](https://es6.io/), [The Complete JavaScript Course](https://www.udemy.com/the-complete-javascript-course/), [React For Beginner by WesBos](https://reactforbeginners.com/), [Learn Redux by WesBos](https://learnredux.com/), [Modern React with Redux](https://www.udemy.com/react-redux/), [React - The Complete Guide (incl Hooks, React Router, Redux)](https://www.udemy.com/react-the-complete-guide-incl-redux/), [Gatsby Bootcamp](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8t0vNu2fCCM), also in the beginning I have read *"JavaScript & jQuery by Jon Duckett"* book.

If you are interested in projects I made with knowledge gathered from this courses you can check them on my <scroll-link to="portfolio">portfolio</scroll-link> section.

I am passionate, committed, hard-working and always want to learn more.
